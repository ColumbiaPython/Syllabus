# Syllabus
Class plan, teaching objects, assignments, textbook, dates, classroom, office hour and more

This is a non-credit course. The only requirement is: 
### You have to make the commitment in Learning, Programming and Sharing.

## Learning objects of this course

1. Build up your resume with Python skills
2. Have your individual data analytics project finished and post in student project showcase server (building in progress)
3. Can talk about basic statistics, machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning in tech interview
4. Know how to approach the analytics problem for take-home interview assignment
4. Can teach other students and friends who ever want to learn programming

## Class plan
This would be a 12-week Introduction to Python for data analytics programming course for TC and Columbia students, every Sunday from 1 pm - 3 pm.

Location: 424 Horace Mann @Teachers College, Columbia University, 120th street cross with Broadway, NYC

9. Dec 2nd 1 - 3 pm NLP Topic: NLP with deep learning 
10. Dec 9th 1 - 3 pm Let's vote for the topic: Web scrabing, Web app development with Flask, Recommendation System, or Time series analysis (HW5: Final Write-up @conference paper format, HW4 due)
11. Dec 16th 1 - 3 pm Student Final Project presentation (HW1-5 project demo)

Each weekly topic could be extented into a semester course. This course is served as an introduction to the programming world. I bring you to the door and tell you how to look at the road signs. You need to walk along the path on your own.

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course, and so as the real world. 
This is a project-based learning course. Each of you might have individual specific interested industry and research method. For each track, I recommend textbooks as below:
### General
Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data by VanderPlas
### Data Visualization
https://matplotlib.org/
### Machine Learning
Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by GÃ©ron
### Deep Learning
Deep Learning with Python by Chollet
### Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing with Python by Bird, Klein and Loper
