## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course, and so as the real world. 
This is a project-based learning course. Each of you will have individual specific interested industry and research method. For each track, I recommend textbooks as below:
General: Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data by VanderPlas
Data Visualization: https://matplotlib.org/
Machine Learning: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by GÃ©ron
Deep Learning: Deep Learning with Python by Chollet
Natural Language Processing: Natural Language Processing with Python by Bird, Klein and Loper
